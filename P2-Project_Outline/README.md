# Sound Minds

## Overview

Sound Minds is a simple, easy-to-use web application which allows users to find new music and share their opinions on it.
Users will be able to easily navigate the application and features in a couple ways. When a user wants to find a song to see what others are saying about it, they can easily search for it. Commenting on the music is just as easy to use. Click on a search result and view details about the song, add it to your favorites, listen to a preview and share your opinion.

This idea came about from years and years of "lunch table debates". Every morning on the way to school, I could get my arguments ready regarding whatever new music came out the night before. With sound minds, there can be a lot less yelling over each other and all voices can be heard.

## Features

- **Search** - _Users will be able to search for songs using the public Deezer API_
- **Signup/ Login** - _Users will be able to create an account and login. There will be protected routes and logic set up to prevent users from commenting and favoriting songs unless they're signed in._
- **Add song to favorites** - _Users can add a song to their favorites and access a list of their favorite songs_
- **Add comments** - _Users will be able to add comments to songs, and reply to other people's comments_
- **Mobile first deign/ Responsiveness** - _The application will have a mobile first design. Mobile user wont struggle navigating the site because they will have their own experience based on screen size_
